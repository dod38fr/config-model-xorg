=head1 Config::Model::Xorg - Xorg configuration tool based on Config::Model

This module provides a Xorg configuration model. 

With this module and L<Config::Model>, you have a tool to tune the
configuration of your favourite X server.

Installing L<Config::Model::TkUI> is recommended as you'll have a more
user friendly curses based user interface.

(You may also want to install L<Config::Model::CursesUI> to get a curses
interface in case Xorg server is down)

Once this module is installed, you can run (as root, but please backup
/etc/X11/xorg.conf before):

  # cme edit xorg

If config-edit fails with your xorg.conf (See BUGS section below), you
can try L<cme> with -force option.

If you do not have the curses user interface, be sure to read doc
which explain the basic command of the terminal based interface in 
L<Config::Model::TermUI>

=head2 Keyboard model

If Xorg is installed on your system, the keyboard model will be
generated by Build.PL from the content of the lst files in your
xkb/rules directory.

If Xorg is not installed, this module will fallback on a keyboard
model created on a Debian GNU/Linux system. (This is done so that CPAN
testers can be run even on servers without Xorg).

=head2 bugs

This model is quite young and is incomplete.

So far, the following video cards have a model (see
lib/Config/Model/models/Xorg/Device/ directory) :

=over

=item *

ATI card (rather complete Radeon.pl model for radeon driver and Fglrx model)

=item *

Nvidia card (very preliminary Nvidia.pl model for Nvidia proprietary
driver)

=back
